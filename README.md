iosentry aka Roman Hunt
I am a system adminitrator, developer, builder, and breaker of wares boft soft and hard.
I have been using Linux systems as my daily driver since kernel version 2.0.34. 
The lack of documentation for and buggy behavior of the old Intel 910 graphics chipset  stole away my 
hopes for X11. A true blessing in disguise because ... Discovering Slackware 3.4 changed my life,
the rest is history...

I even ran Yellow Dog 1.1 (painfully) on a Blue and White Mac G3 tower. Ugh... By 1998 I had become obsessed with information security. 
I cut my teeth in the good old days when a demonic group of bovine idolaters were hip (CDC), 
Attrition.org was THE place to get posted up AND be called a script kiddie at the same time, these were 
industrial and heavy days when kids hung in Massachusetts attics and Mudge looked like a pot-head (l0pht).
I spent some years embarrasingly active on irc.2600.net and still keep in contact with some of them... Albeit on 
LinkedIn...

I subscribed to and unsubscribed from bugtraq at least 25 times over the years due to my lack of interest in cross-site scripting vulns.
I hacked perl during the v5.4 / v5.6 golden days. I believed in perl 6 and shunned Python... How wrong I was.....
All this is to say... I'm fucking old and I've been here a while.
