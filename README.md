@IO-sentry aka Roman Hunt
I am a system adminitrator, developer, builder, and breaker of wares boft soft and hard.
I have been using Linux systems as my daily driver since kernel version 2.0.34. The lack of
documentation and buggy behavior of the old Intel 910 graphics chipset on the only machine
available while working for a non-profit and tasked with a gargantuan project stole away my 
hopes for X11... A true blessing in disguise... Discovering Slackware 3.4 would change my life
and the rest is history...

I ran Yellow Dog 1.1 (painfully) on a Blue and White Mac G3 tower. Ouch...

By 1998 I had become obsessed with information security. I cut my teeth in the good old day when a demonic
group of bovine idolaters were hip (CotDC), Attrition.org was THE place to get posted AND be called a script kiddie,
industrial and heavy days when kids hung in Massachusetts attics and Mudge looked like a pot-head (the L0pht days).
I spent some years embarrasingly active on irc.2600.net and still keep in contact with some of them... Albeit on 
LinkedIn!!!

I subscribed and unsubscribed to bugtraq at least 25 times due to my lack of interest in cross-site scripting vulns.
I hacked perl during the v5.4 / v5.6 golden days. I believed in perl 6 and shunned Python... Ha! Cant always be right...

All this is to say... I'm fucking old and I've been here a while.
